# SpheroEmoStudy
Experiments to see if the Sphero can express feelings through its limited ability of expression.

This is a part of HRI-2k17 at The University of Texas at Austin in Fall 2017. We aim to study the limited expressive capabilites 
of the Sphero Robot, and possibly enable it to learn emotional expressions through human feedback.
